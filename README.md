# project-alias package

Atom uses the name of the selected folder as the projects name.  
If you have multiple projects, which for example have the same name of the parent directory, it easily gets confusing.  
This package allows you to rename existing projects.  
Additionally, these projects aliases will be restored whenever you restart the Editor. Even if you remove the project and add it later on.
